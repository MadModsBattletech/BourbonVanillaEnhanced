# Sustainable Evasion

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Skilled pilots can sustain some of their evasion while being fired at.

## Gameplay changes
* Pilots with evasive movement can now uphold some evasive charges.
  * Only moving and sprinting allows to sustain evasion
  * Amount of sustainable evasion depends on the base initiative of the piloted unit.
  * Ace pilots gain an additional sustainable pip
  * Master Tacticians gain a bonus pip too as they rise the base initiative (Scouts)
  * Melee attacks and sensor lock can still strip this kind of evasive charges
* Sustainable evasion is highlighted in the UI
  * Sustainable pips are colored green
  * Description in side panel also reflects state
